  <h1>Mount Sinai</h1> 
  <section id="blog">
       <article>
         <p>Mount Sinai is a mountain (7497 feet) on the Sinai Peninsula of the Asian part of Egypt, where, Moses is said, have received the Ten Commandments according to the Torah, Bible and Quran. It is a part of a complex of mountains and surrounded on all sides by higher peaks. The major attraction of the area is a tour to the summit of the mountain to observe the sunrise.  </p>
         <p>The adventure begins at midnight, you start in the camel station where you are assigned a camel and a Bedouin guide. Nights are extremely cold and the higher, the more difficult it is to breath. About halfway you continue your journey by foot, climbing in a very rocky area and at times near the cliff. At about 5:30 am you arrive at the summit where the sunrise can be observed in all its glory.</p>

         <h2>The Summit</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Once you reach the summit, you encounter a view, whose beauty cannot be captured in a photo. The natural beauty of the place and the sunrise in the middle of this desertic mountain area is very unique. Once the sun shines, one can see several historic places like a mosque that is used by the local muslims and a Greek Orthodox chapel that is no longer open to the public. </p>

          <h2>Descending the Mountain</h2>
         <article>
          <p>There are two routes to do the summit and come back. One can take The Steps of Penitence and has 3,750 steps carved by hand and dates back to the 6th century. The second route is the Camel Trail dating back to the 19th century, one can ride a camel from the trailhead up to the Steps of Penitence for the remainder 750 steps, and descend by foot until you reach the camel tent and hop on the camel back to the initial station, by then it is very sunny and warmer .</p>
